# EIGER Quasar Host Galaxies

This repository host the code and data used in "EIGER V. Characterizing the Host Galaxies of Luminous Quasars at z \gtrsim 6" (Yue+24; https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04614).

The directories are organized as follows:

* epsf/: effective PSF building.

* image\_fitting/: fitting the image of the quasars to obtain the host galaxy fluxes (i.e., "PSF-subtraction")

* sed\_fitting: the Prospector models to estimate the properties of the host galaxies

* spec\_fitting: fitting the grism spectra of the quasars to measure the H beta line profiles and calculate their black hole masses

More detailed description can be found in each directory.
